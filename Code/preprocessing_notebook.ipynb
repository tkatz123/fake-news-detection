      "Title: Clinton clear on Trump: 'We were not friends': People magazine\n",
      "\n",
      "Text:\n",
      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wants to set the record straight on Donald Trump: “We were not friends.” “We knew each other, obviously, in New York,” Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York, said in excerpts of a People magazine interview released on Wednesday. “I knew a lot of people.” Trump, the real estate billionaire whose standing as Republican front-runner was dented by a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, had long touted his friendship with Bill and Hillary Clinton. In a March 2012 Fox News interview, Trump praised Clinton as a “terrific woman.” “I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard,” Trump told Fox. But the Clintons, who attended Trump’s 2005 wedding, were fair game on the campaign trail.  In November, Trump said Hillary Clinton did not have strength or stamina to be president and called her the worst U.S. secretary of state, a post she held from 2009 to 2013. When Clinton denounced Trump last month for showing “a penchant for sexism,” Trump turned the phrase against her, using it to refer to Bill Clinton’s sexual scandals as president. Trump’s caustic comments about Hispanics, women, Muslims and his rivals for the nomination have set much of the tone for the Republican race.  Clinton has accused him of being divisive and a bully. Clinton told People she could handle Trump’s barbs, but worried about the immigrants and American Muslims he targets. “I’m more concerned about the tone that is being set in the political debate this year because the last thing our country needs right now is more divisiveness, more mean-spiritedness,” she said.  It was not clear when the People interview, which included Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, was conducted. Clinton won the Iowa Democratic caucuses over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday.  “I really care about what he says about other people, who don’t have the voice and the platform,” Clinton said, referring to immigrants and American Muslims. Chelsea Clinton said she has never had a relationship with Donald Trump but remains friends with his daughter, Ivanka. “I do believe that friendship is more important than politics,” she told People. “I would never hold anyone accountable for what their parents or anyone else in their family said or did.”  (Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bill Trott) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

      "El popular actor Dani Rovira será el encargado de dirigirse este año a los españoles en el tradicional mensaje de Navidad. Hasta ahora, ningún ciudadano de a pie había conseguido este privilegio, reservado al Rey de España. \n",
      "La trayectoria del actor ha vivido una tendencia inversa a la de la monarquía. Desde su debut en “8 apellidos vascos”, su popularidad ha ido en aumento, al contrario que los Borbones, que han notado como el caso Nóos les ha pasado factura. “Era el momento idóneo”, afirma Rovira. Además, está seguro de que la repercusión de salir en todos los canales a la vez le beneficiará de cara a su siguiente gran reto: intepretar al español al que le ha tocado la Lotería este año. \n",
      "Rovira no ha querido avanzar nada del contenido del mensaje, aunque ha prometido muchas sorpresas. “Es posible que aparezca Carmen Machi en algún momento interpretando a doña Letizia, peo por ahora no hay nada seguro”, ha explicado el intérprete y cómico. Según fuentes cercanas al actor, él mismo estaría escribiendo parte de texto, que incluirá reflexiones sobre lo diferentes que son hombres y mujeres y lo mala que está la comida de los aviones. \n",
      "Juan José Cela, representante del cómico, explica que Rovira lleva varias semanas preparándose para el papel, empeorando su dicción e incluso viajando a Arabia Saudí para cerrar negocios turbios. \n",
      "La Casa Real no ha querido pronunciarse al respecto. Únicamente ha comentado que Rovira es una buena alternativa al Rey, ya que haber trabajado en “8 apellidos vascos” y “8 apellidos catalanes” le otorga una legitimidad “más que razonable” para afrontar la cuestión del desafío secesionista. \n",

      "\n",
      "Text:\n",
      "43 days and counting Characterizing the military s mission as a fight against  violent extremism,  Obama insisted that soldiers need to rise up against Trump if they feel he is pushing policies that are ill considered.Obama told the troops,  each of us has the universal right to speak your minds and to protest against authority; to live in a society that s open and free; that can criticize our president without retribution. Obama went on to insist that a proper U.S. policy against  violent extremism  is a  long term  policy. So rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs or deploying more and more troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world,  Obama said,  we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat. And we have to pursue a smart strategy that can be sustained. In the time remaining, let me just suggest what I think should guide this approach. In addressing the war-torn Middle East, Obama insisted that global warming forms a large part of that conflict.  A changing climate is increasing competition for food and water,  which, he claimed, drives the conflict in Syria and other nearby nations.Obama also blamed the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution for  violent extremism  in the United States. Somebody who is trying to kill and willing to be killed is dangerous, particularly when we live in a country where it s very easy for that person to buy a very powerful weapon,  Obama insisted. The president also defended Islam against the charge of extremism:We are fighting terrorists who claim to fight on behalf of Islam. But they do not speak for over a billion Muslims around the world, and they do not speak for American Muslims including many who wear the uniform of the United States of America s military. If we stigmatize good patriotic Muslims, that just feeds the terrorists  narrative. It fuels the same false grievances they they use to motivate people to kill. If we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, we re not gonna lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but we ll also lose the sight of the very principles we claim to defend.As to the rise of ISIS, Obama insisted it was not given aide by his actions of pulling out of Iraq in 2011 but was instead given succor by the policies of George W. Bush. By 2011, Iraqis wanted our military presence to end, and they were unwilling to sign a new status of forces agreement to protect our troops from prosecution if they were trying to defend themselves in Iraq,  Obama proclaimed.  In addition, maintaining American troops in Iraq at the time could not have reversed the forces that contributed to ISIL s rise.   Breitbart \n",

      "\n",
      "Text:\n",
      "Donald Trump told an audience in Fresno, California on Friday, that there is no drought in California. This has to be the most absurd claim that Trump has made during his campaign. During the event, Trump implied that the water shortage in California was created by the government and environmentalists. We re going to solve your water problem. You have a water problem that is so insane. It is so ridiculous where they re taking the water and shoving it out to sea,  Trump told the crowd made up of mostly California farmers. They don t understand it. There is no drought, they turn the water out into the ocean. California has been in a state of drought for half a decade. In 2015, the drought was less severe than it has been in previous years. Though to claim that there is no drought and to imply that California s water shortage problem has been solely caused by poor water management systems is ridiculous.Trump pointed towards efforts to keep the Delta Smelt, or  a three-inch fish  as Trump referred to it in his speech, from going extinct as an example of environmentalists and the big-bad-government stealing water away from farmers. While water has been redirected in a last-ditch attempt to save the species from complete extinction, the idea that it has had any major impact on farmers is nothing more than a flimsy talking point.Trump is pandering to California farmers who are trying to get legislation passed to build new water infrastructure that would help farmers out. It s probably just due to the fact that he is Trump, that he has chosen to do so in such a ludicrous fashion. I m personally surprised that Trump is spending so much time trying to win over voters in California, a state that is certain to vote blue in November.You can watch the event below in full.Featured image via video screenshot\n",

    "These five sample articles offer meaningful insight into the types of preprocessing necessary to prepare the text for effective modeling. Several key cleaning operations have been identified based on this initial review:\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Convert all text to lowercase**: Standardizing case helps reduce vocabulary size and ensures that semantically identical words (e.g., “President” and “president”) are treated equivalently. This is especially important when using bag-of-words or TF-IDF representations, where case differences would otherwise be interpreted as separate tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Remove punctuation**: Punctuation rarely contributes meaningful information in traditional NLP classification tasks, and its removal simplifies the tokenization process. This also reduces sparsity in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Eliminate redundant whitespace**: Extra spaces introduced by removing punctuation, URLs, or formatting artifacts can create inconsistencies. Normalizing whitespace ensures cleaner tokenization and more consistent feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Remove content within parentheses**: In many cases, parenthetical text contains metadata such as newswire sources (e.g., “(Reuters)”), which may bias the model or introduce non-generalizable patterns. Removing this content encourages the model to focus on the article's substantive content rather than source attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Remove stop words**: Stop words are common terms such as “the,” “is,” and “and” that typically carry little semantic weight in text classification. Removing them reduces noise and allows the model to focus on more informative tokens that are better indicators of content or tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the impact of these steps and ensure correctness, we will first apply them to a single article. This trial implementation will serve as the foundation for designing a reusable text-cleaning function to be integrated into the preprocessing script."

      "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s United Nations envoy on Tuesday criticized U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein s remarks on systemic violence in the country, saying they reflected  flawed logic , state news agency MENA reported. Ambassador Amr Ramadan was quoted as saying that he had cautioned Zeid against his office becoming a  mouthpiece for paid agencies with political and economic agendas,  and he rejected his accusations, without elaborating. At a UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva on Monday, Hussein said the state of emergency declared by the Egyptian government last April had been used to justify  systemic silencing of civil society.  He cited reports of waves of arrests, arbitrary detention, black-listing, travel bans, asset freezes, intimidation and other reprisals against human rights defenders, journalists, political dissidents and those affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood group. Last week Egypt came under fire from Human Rights Watch, which said in a report that there was systemic torture in the country s jails, leading Cairo to block access to HRW s website. Egypt s human rights parliamentary committee, which was critical of the report, has also developed an action plan in response, state media reported on Tuesday.
